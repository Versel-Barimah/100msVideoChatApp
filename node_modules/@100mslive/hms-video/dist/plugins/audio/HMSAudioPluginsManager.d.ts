 * Audio Plugin - A module which can take in input audio, do some processing on it and return an AudioNode
 *
 * For Each Plugin, an AudioNode will be created and the source will be created from local audio track.
 * Each Audio node will be connected in the following order
 * source -> first plugin -> second plugin -> third plugin .. so on
